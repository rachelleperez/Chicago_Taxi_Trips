    "You're working as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. Your task is to find patterns in the available information. You want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.\n",

Chicago taxis are operated by private companies and licensed by the city's [Business Affairs and Consumer Protection](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/bacp/supp_info/medallion_owner_information.html) agency. Unlike other cities, Chicago taxis can be [any color](https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/chicago/latest/chicago_il/0-0-0-2490014) (but matching their affiliated private company if not independent). \n",

    "* **O'Hare International Airport**: Any airport in a large city is expected to be popular, but this is not just any airport.

    "* After taking a sample of two days (11/15/17 - 11/16/17), the **2 most successful companies (based on trip count) are 'Flash Cab' and 'Taxi Affiliate Service'**.\n",
    "* If we look at these two companies over a full week (11/1/17 - 11/7/17), **'Flash Cab' and 'Taxi Affiliation Services' combined make up 23.24% of all trips within a week** despite there being a total of 64 companies. ('Flash Cab' has ~15% of all trips while 'Taxi Affiliation Services' has ~8%)\n",
    "* As mentioned, Chicago's taxis could be any color but we can see companies brand themselves around colors that help recognition. **If we look at trips from companies that use either the word 'Yellow' or the word 'Blue' in their name, companies with 'Yellow' executed 72% of such trips** after looking at data for a full week (11/1/17-11/7/17). The strategy of associating with the color yellow, a common taxi color in other cities, seems successful. As a matter of fact, it was in Chicago that the tradition of yellow cabs originated. The ['Yellow Cab Company'](https://yellowcabchicago.com/about-us/) founded in 1907 in Chicago is North America's oldest and largest taxicab company. Its founder John Hertz [\"got the idea for the color from a study by a local university that found that yellow with a touch of red was the most visible color over greater distances\"](https://time.com/4640097/yellow-taxi-cabs-history/). John Hertz would continue his streak. He is perhaps best known for [purchasing Chicago-based Rent-A-Car in 1923 (only 5 years old then after being founded in 1918)](https://www.hertz.com/blog/automotive/how-22-year-old-with-12-modelt-ts-created-hertz) which immediately renamed to 'Hertz Drive-Ur-Self System' and it is now the publicly traded company 'The Hertz Corporation'.\n",

    "\n",
    "In testing the hypothesis that **\"the duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays\"**, I confirmed this is a true statement based on observations from November 2017 (as available). The average trip duration on Saturdays with 'bad' weather (rain or storm) is ~ 40 minutes (2427.21 seconds) while the average trip duration on 'good' weather days is ~33 minutes (1999.68 seconds). Hence, **the same Saturday trip from the Loop to O'Hare is ~7 minutes longer (427.53 seconds) when there is 'bad' weather compared to 'good' weather days**.\n",

It is clear there are some neighborhoods that are MUCH more popular based on dropoff trips (with Loop at the top being more that double the fourth). Upon a closer look at where these neighborhoods are actually located from [THIS MAP](https://www.choosechicago.com/neighborhoods/), a pattern becomes clear. The top 4 neighborhoods are adjacent. With Loop being the most popular, the next 3 neighborhoods surround it. We can conclude that **the most popular area for trips is in or around the Loop neighborhood** or the center of Downtown Chicago."

    "It is clear **Flash Cab is the leader in this market. Zuber should partner with or model their service after Flash Cab.**. Without domain experience, it is hard for me to know exactly why/how they have reached this level of success. **Zuber should consider hiring a consultant with domain experience in the Chicago taxi sector to get a clear understanding of what differentiates Chicago taxi companies**. From a quick look at the Flash Cab website versus the next few companies, it is clear Flash Cab takes care of their brand and marketing with a robust site, app, distict cab colors (white/blue), and good user interface. Although this inclination may be true, I again reiterate this is not my domain. "

    "A new ride-sharing company **Zuber** is looking to launch in Chicago, IL (USA). As an analysr for Zuber, I have been tasked with answering \"What Affects a Ride?\" by finding patterns relating to passenger preference and the impact of external factors on rides. \n",
    "\n",
    "After analyzing a public data sample of taxicab trips from November 2017 and weather reports, the following insights were discovered: \n",
    "* **Flash Cab is the most successful taxicab company in Chicago** doing almost double the trips as the next company (Taxi Affiliation Services). Due to its overwhelming success, Zuber should consider looking more closely into what this company is doing to achieve such success, perhaps by hiring a consultant with domain experience in the local cab industry. In addition, Zuber should recruit drivers from Flash Cab for its service as they will come in 'Flash Cab' branded cars which due to its popularity might be more trusted.\n",
    "* Although Chicago cabs can be any color, **taxi  use color strategically to be better identified** (or perhaps to be identified with successful competitors) which became evident as many used it as part of branding in their name and particularly relied on the \"yellow\" color (a natural choice due to its popularity in other cities and its origin in Chicago).  If possible, Zuber should recruit drivers with taxi cab colors identified with more reputable companies (like Blue/white for Flash Cab or the recognized yellow if others).\n",
    "* Although Chicago boasts over 90 distinct neighborhoods, **most trips end in the Loop area or surrounding within Downtown Chicago**. Zuber could consider going head to head with these companies in that area or perhaps an even better opportunity of trying to encourage customers outside this area to use Zuber as assumingly they might not be serviced well by the current system. \n",
    "* **Weather plays a significant effect on trip duration with bad weather days yielding longer duration for the same trip**. As longer trips lead to cabs being busy in their trips longer and less supply. Zuber must consider the effect on weather on pricing. Should there be a \"bad weather\" surcharge? Should charge be based on duration so they end up being more expensive on bad weather days? "
